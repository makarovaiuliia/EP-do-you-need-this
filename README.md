# "Do you need this" project
## *[link](https://github.com/makarovaiuliia/ono-tebe-nado.git "link to project repository")* 

**Project description:** this is my first educational project. I used there only primitive instruments of HTML and CSS, but, of course, this was a huge jump for me. And I want to save this project to always have a possibility to look from where I've started in the future. This is a web-page about an auction. It contains a header, a cover, a list of lots for auction, a small description about the auction house and footer with contact information.
